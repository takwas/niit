C# OOP Class
==================
State - Describes the data attributes of an object
Behaviour
Identity

Types of Data Types:
	- Value Types: A value type variable directly contains the data stored in it. Memory is allocated
	every time to store each new value of value-type data. Predefined types: 'char', 'int', 'float', 'double'
	and 'bool'	are examples.
	
	- Reference Types: Actual data value is stored in a separate location and the address
	of that location is stored (referenced) by the declared variable. If multiple variables reference
	the same memory address, any change made to the stored value is reflected in all the variables.
	'string' and other object types are reference types.
	

Member Functions
	public void MethodName()	// function header declaration
	{
		// function body definition goes here ...
	}

Instantiating a Class
	ClassName identifier = new ClassName();
	


==============================================

Operators:
	- Arithmetic operators
	- Arithmetic assignment operators
	- Unary operators
	- Comparison (Relational) operators
	- Logical operators
----------------------------------------------------
Conditional Constructors
	- if .. else constructs
	- switch .. case constructs

Nested 'if .. else' constructs are also called "cascading if ..else" constructs.

----------------------------------------------------

Loop Constructs
	- while loop
	- do .. while loop
	- for loop
	
All the components in the declaration of a "for loop" construct are optional, like so:
	for ( ; ; )
	{
		// for loop body goes here ...
	}
